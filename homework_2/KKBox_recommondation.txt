song_id
song name - the name of the song.
isrc - International Standard Recording Code, theoretically can be used as an identity of a song. However, what worth to note is, ISRCs generated from providers have not been officially verified; therefore the information in ISRC, such as country code and reference year, can be misleading/incorrect. Multiple songs could share one ISRC since a single recording could be re-published several times.

在这个任务中，你会被要求预测一个用户在一个时间窗口内的第一个可观察的监听事件被触发后重复收听一首歌曲的机会。如果在用户第一次可观察的监听事件之后的一个月内触发重复的监听事件，则其目标被标记为1，否则在训练集中为0。同样的规则适用于测试集。

KKBOX提供了一个训练数据集，其中包含特定时间段内每个唯一用户歌曲对的第一个可观察收听事件的信息。还提供了每个唯一用户和歌曲对的元数据。鼓励使用公共数据来提高预测的准确性。
